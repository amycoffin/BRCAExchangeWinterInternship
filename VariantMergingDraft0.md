# **Variant Merging Tile**  
___  

The primary function of the BRCA Exchange[^1] is to aggregate data related to BRCA gene variants from multiple sources, including ClinVar, PubMed, and LOVD. There are a number of reasons this data aggregation is a difficult task: the same variant may be referred to by different names and pseudonyms, some of the data is redundant, data from one source may conflict with another. In order for variant research to be an efficient and satisfactory experience, the BRCA Exchange must ensure that the data for one variant is:  
1. properly assembled in one place  
2. that the sources for data are displayed  
3. that conflicts between data are not erased.  

This project is called *variant merging*, and it removes redundancy while maintaining unresolved data disagreement.
