# BRCA Exchange Winter Internship 2019

Thank you for joining the BRCA Exchange as an intern this quarter. You will collaborate with me on a project using this repository. 

This quarter, we will learn how to fork a master repository, clone it locally, make changes using a branch, push your changes to your fork, and finally, submit a Pull Request so that these changes may be reflected in the master repository. 

Begin by downloading git onto your local machine. Now, visiting the BRCAExchangeWinterInternship repo, clone this repo onto your local machine. Once the repo is cloned locally, make the below changes.   

1. Make sure you are in /BRCAExchangeWinterInternship

2. Using the following command, make your own branch, calling it 'smallUpdates'
git branch "small updates"
git checkout small updates"
 
3. Using VIM or PyCharm or the editor of your choice, make a change to this file, adding "McKenna was here" below: 
McKenna was here
4. Use the following commands to add and commit your changes:

git add README.md
git commit README.md -m "changed ReadMe"

The file has now been changed and commited to your local git repo. Visit the github repo through github.com. Do you see this change in the ReadMe? 

3. The answer to the above is no, because you only committed to your local git repo. Now it is time to PUSH these changes to a remote branch:

git push

You may have to type in your github account and password. 

Now do you see the changes reflected? No? In the github.com UI, while visiting the repo, click branch. Do you see your branch? Great, click it. Now do you see the changes reflected? Awesome. 

4. Now, you want to make a pull request. This can be done with the github UI. 

4. The answer is no. This is because you need to submit a pull request, requesting that I merge your changes into the master repository.
