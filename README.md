# BRCA Exchange Winter Internship 2019

Thank you for joining the BRCA Exchange as an intern this quarter. You will collaborate with me on a project using this repository. 

This quarter, we will learn how to fork a master repository, clone it locally, make changes using a branch, push your changes to your fork, and finally, submit a Pull Request so that these changes may be reflected in the master repository. 

Begin by downloading git onto your local machine. Now, visiting the BRCAExchangeWinterInternship repo, clone this repo onto your local machine. Once the repo is cloned locally, make the below changes.   

1. Make sure you are in /BRCAExchangeWinterInternship

2. Run a git pull origin master command to ensure you are up to date. Now, use git checkout -b draftZero to make a branch for this assignment. 

3. Using Google Docs, write a "draft 0" of the docs we are working on creating. Pretend that I am a clueless mentor who has asked you to write these docs without much background knowledge of the site. Based on our limited conversations and your exposure to the project, write up as much as you know about variant merging on brcaexchange.org. This does not have to be good, accurate, or complete. The idea is to get you started thinking about the docs.  

4. Once you are relatively satisfied with your draft 0, copy and paste all text into a .txt file using TextEdit. Go to the top left, and hit Format > Make Plain Text. This helps resolve any weird underlying special characters and unicode that might be in the file. Without this step, you might end up getting an "unexpected token" error if the markdown was rendered in javascript for brcaexchange.org. 

5. Then, either using TextEdit or vim, format the file in markdown. Use [this guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started) to get started, and [this markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) for formatting rules and guidelines.  


6. OPEN the VariantMergingDraft0.md file using vim. Many editors have trouble with markdown files, so vim is a pretty good editor for this. Delete the existing content, and replace it with your draft 0.

7. Using vim, write up this week's reflection in a new .md file using markdown format, and ensuring that the file is a .md. Reflect on using git and markdown.  

8. Submit a pull request to merge the changes from the branch into the repo's master branch.
