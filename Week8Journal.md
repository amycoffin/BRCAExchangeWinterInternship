## **Reflection:**
I was pretty busy this week with the internship. I spent almost 5 hours on transcribing & editing notes of two focus groups. I found this process super interesting. It’s interesting to compare the responses of international counselors with those working within the US legal and private model. Just to get a sense, ethnographically, of the perceived barriers to data sharing & the everyday frustrations with data access. I liked being a part of this process, and it seemed to help Amy a lot. 

I spent most of my Thursday trying to figure out where and how to properly store installed software so that PyCharm would recognize the imported software in Amy’s venn diagram program. I ended up uninstalling all related software and reinstalling. This was super helpful, and I’m glad I did it. The locations of all my software was so messed up and confused because I had no idea what I was doing when I took the python class, and I still am confused about the usefulness of Jupyter. Anyway, it’s all figure out now, and Amy helped me figure out how to properly set the interpreter of a PyCharm project (something that was previously lost to me). Her code produces the desired image. What a success!

I’m currently waiting for vim to finish downloading so I can finish my second github assignment. Regaining my familiarity with unix commands & directory navigation, and feeling confident about my understanding of github push/pulls. I feel excited to be learning all this again in a structured way. (Thank you Amy, you’re awesome!)

As a 60-second project, I also figured out how to set up a google hangouts invite.
