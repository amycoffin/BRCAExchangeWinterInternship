The BRCA Exchange is a curated data platform that provides information on variants of specific genes: BRCA1 and BRCA2. Rather than contributing new information about a variant, the BRCA Exchange becomes a single source that collects and organizes existing information. The BRCA Exchange retrieves data from a variety of databases, such as ClinVar and LOVD. Using these sources, BRCA Exchange answers three basic questions about a variant:

* What is the most definitive clinical interpretation available for this variant?

* When was this interpretation made?

* What publicly available data informed this interpretation?

There are two data views used by BRCA Exchange to aid researchers and clinicians who work with BRCA1 and BRCA2. The Summary View of BRCA Exchange will only display variant aliases, ENIGMA variant interpretations, and a brief interpretation history. The ENIGMA Consortium assesses variant pathogenicity using an expertly developed set of BRCA1 and BRCA2 classification criteria. The Detail View contains all publicly available data on a variant. Thus, this view of the data provides a more complete, but also more complicated, characterization of a variant. Using multiple large-scale sources and two different portals, BRCA Exchange serves as a contextualized resource for curation of BRCA variant data.
