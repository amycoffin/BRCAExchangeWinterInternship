## **Reflection:**    
This journal reflects my time during Week 10 and half of finals week. I finished my final project for the internship (Variant Merging Documentation) on Wednesday night. This bulk of my energy during this week and a half period was dedicated to this assignment. It was challenging to write because I did not realize how little I understood Variant Merging. In order to make sense of Melissa’s explanation, I made a few cognitive gaps that were inconsistent with reality. These leaps were hard for both Amy and I to identify, but when we did, I had an easier time drafting the documentation. I also focused more, in writing the second version, on what was important for the user to understand. I realize for the first piece of documentation, I was mostly writing to generate my own comprehension of the problem. But in my second approach, I was able to focus much more on the goal of communication— I only included the information that was pertinent for understanding Variant Merging and why it is so important that the BRCA Exchange engages in variant merging. I am happy with my final work product, although I wish I had a little bit more time to keep revising it with Amy. It was a super interesting and fun challenge. 

I also met with Melissa this week to talk about my future with the BRCA Exchange. I am happy to keep my irons in the BRCA fire.
