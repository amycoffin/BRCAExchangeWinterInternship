## **Reflection:**    
I spent more time in meetings this week than working on assignments. The most interesting part of the week was the Data Merging Documentation meeting and my review notes. The meeting started with broad ideas about the possibilities of new content, and was quickly funneled into a recognition that the missing documentation is minimal but key to understanding the BRCA Exchange project. I played a key role in determining this approach. Over my final two weeks in the quarter, I will work on prototyping a few drafts of this content & refining one. I notice the important of fresh eyes on an old & embedded project.
